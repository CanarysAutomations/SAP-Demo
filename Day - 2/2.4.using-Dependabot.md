# 2.4 Enabling and using Dependabot on your repository
The hands-on lab has the goal to learn you how to enable the Dependency and Dependabot features and gain hands-on experience with Dependatbot's ability to update your dependencies automatically.

This hands on lab consists of the following steps:
- [Enabling the Dependency features](#enabling-the-dependency-features)
- [Dependabot alerts](#dependabot-alerts)

## Enabling the Dependency features
Let's start with enabling the following features on your repository. When you navigate to the `Settings` tab on your repository, under the `Configure security and analysis features` you will find the following features. Go ahead and click `Enable` for each of these features:
* Dependency graph
* Dependabot alerts

Now that you have enabled the Dependabot features, let's have some hands-on experience with this functionality.

## Dependabot alerts
Dependabot alerts track security vulnerabilities that apply to your repositoryâ€™s dependencies. When you navigate to the `Security` tab on your repository, and click `Dependabot alerts`, you can see the active alerts generated by Dependabot.

When you click on an alert, you can see the details on that alert. Let's have a look at an example alert. Dependabot will show you details on the vulnerability and a suggested remediation. Review the details of the vulnerability and, if available, the pull request containing the automated security update. Optionally, if there isn't already a Dependabot security updates update for the alert, to create a pull request to resolve the vulnerability, click `Create Dependabot security update`.
